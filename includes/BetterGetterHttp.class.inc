/**
 * Extension of Better Getter class for handling HTTP connections.
 *
 * An aspect of handling HTTP which is unique is HTTP headers, which are sent
 * by both the client and the server as part of a connection. This class
 * features methods for specifying outgoing HTTP headers for a connection, as
 * well as parsing out incoming HTTP headers from the server response.
 *
 * @todo: Authentication, compression, HTTPS/SSL certificate handling, cookie
 * handling, et al.
 */

  /**
   * An associative array of headers to be sent as part of the server request,
   * keyed by header field name.
   *
   * Each value is a flat array of values. Why an array instead of a string?
   * Because it's theoretically possible to send headers repeated with different
   * values, though I'm not sure if this is in common use.
   *
   * Note that when a request happens, this param is nulled out, then rebuilt
   * using the actual headers sent to the server. Why? Because some cURL options
   * may define outgoing HTTP headers which wouldn't be explicitly set by using
   * the setRequestHeader() method, and therefore not be in this array, even
   * though they were set to the server. For example, the CURLOPT_USERAGENT
   * option will cause a User-Agent header to be sent to the server which won't
   * normally be in this array. However, it is possible to get the "real"
   * request headers that cURL sent as a string after execution, and then parse
   * them into an array in the format we're using here. However, it only really
   * makes sense to do so if the user actually tries to get the request headers.
   * So we check in getRequestHeaders() and rebuild if necessary in there.
